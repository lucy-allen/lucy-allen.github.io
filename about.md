Hi everyone! Welcome to my blog, my name is Lucy and I am an aspiring Data Scientist! I am really excited to share my experiences learning Data Science with you all!

I graduated from Colgate University in 2018 with a degree in mathematical economics and decided I want to use that degree in the field of Data Science.  I completed a year of service with AmeriCorps in 2018-2019 and am now really excited to move on with my life and focus on Data Science. In order to get into the data science field, I enrolled in a 12 week immersive Data Science Bootcamp through Metis.  During this bootcamp the goal is to provide myself and the rest of my cohort with all of the skills we need to be able to succeed in a data science job.
