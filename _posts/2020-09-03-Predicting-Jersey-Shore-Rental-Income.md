title: Predicting Jersey Shore Rental Income
---

### Motivation

One of my absolute favorite places to be is at the beach!  During the summer I spend most of my weekends there and some full weeks. My happy place is and always has been Stone Harbor, a beach town on the Jersey Shore.  There are always houses on the market in Stone Harbor as there are elsewhere, and I really enjoy window shopping for houses.  As a recent college graduate, I am no where near being able to afford a house, let alone a beach house, so this time spent window shopping should probably be referred to as day dreaming instead.  But hopefully someday this day dreaming can become a reality!  As a very mathematically minded person persuing Data Science, I thought "How can I use my data science skills to help myself afford a beach house?" And that is exactly the question I plan to answer in the rest of this blog.  



### Methodology

Stone Harbor is located in Cape May County New Jersey, so this is where I focused my research, however this methodology could be used in other areas as well, given there is sufficient data available.  There are many rental platforms out in the world
