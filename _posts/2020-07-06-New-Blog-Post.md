Hey everyone, my name is Lucy Allen and I am an aspiring Data Scientist with this blog to share what I have done so far in the field.  I graduated from Colgate University in May of 2018 with a degree in Mathematical Economics.  I have always really loved math and numbers and especially preferred the applied area of math.  Some of my favorite math courses in college were Probabilty, Statistics, and Applied Math: Social Sciences.  Combining math with economics introduced me to additional applied math concepts and courses, such as Games and Strategies, Econometrics, and Behavioral Economics.  While thinking about my future after college I knew the classes and subjects that I really enjoyed learning and studying, but still couldn't quite figure out what it is that I wanted to do as a career with that knowledge that I had gained.

After seeing a position for an AmeriCorps program on Colgate's career page, I decided a year of service with AmeriCorps would be a great way to spend the first year post college.  This position was an Urban Education Fellowship at a charter school in Newark, NJ, with the main responsibility of tutoring students in either math or english language arts.  My love and knowledge of math made me an ideal tutor for seventh and eight grade students in math. While I knew that I never wanted to pursue a career in education as an instructor, the experiences I gained through that year were invaluable.  However, other than gaining an interest in the education industry, I still did not have any more of an idea about what I wanted to pursue as a more long term career.  

I spent a decent amount of time searching for jobs and trying to figure out what it is I wanted to do with my life.  As I looked a so many jobs, I realized that both my interests and knowledge base both aligned well with data science and data analyst jobs, so that's where I went to continue my search , but quickly realized college did not provide me with all of the necessary technical skills that these positions all desired.  This is the point in my life where I decided to try and learn these skills on my own and started studying some python and SQL.  While I was able to teach myself some python and SQL I also started looking into bootcamps as I thought that might provide a better and more efficient way to learn data science. 

This is where Metis came into my life.  After researching many different data science bootcamps, I decided on Metis being the best one for me and applied immediately.  This blog is where I will share the projects I work on and create during the bootcamp as well as projects I start after the bootcamp.
