Hi everyone! I am really excited to share my experiences learning Data Science with you all!  

I graduated from Colgate University in 2018 with a degree in mathematical economics and decided I want to use that degree in the field of Data Science.  I completed a year of service with AmeriCorps in 2018-2019 and am now really excited to move on with my life and focus on Data Science.
